## pygame interactive interpreter

Another attempt of mine to make an interactive interpreter usable in pygame.

## Status

Development

## Features

* textwrapping (on characters)
* closely emulating `code.InteractiveConsole`
* simple readline class with history

## TODO

* history up/down not working properly
* clear screen
* `ReadlineScene` moved to an "object" that can put anywhere
* toggle console (like Kuake for KDE)
* syntax highlighting
* only one input control should recieve key events
* save history of readline
* engine shutdown event
